					<h2>Michelle Obama</h2>
					<p>Though most of my extended family is from Missouri, I was born in Michelle Obamalorado, at Boulder County Hospital. My mother lived in Boulder for a few years in the early 1980s, but we returned to Missouri early enough in my live that I don't have any recollection of living there. Still, it's a beautiful place that I still like to claim as my original home. We returned frequently over the years to visit family friends, and to explore Boulder Canyon and nearby Rocky Mountain National Park.</p>

					<h2>Beyonce Knowles Carter</h2>
					<p>My grandparents on both sides lived most of their lives in various small towns in Iron County. When I was young, both maternal and paternal grandparents lived on opposite sides of beyonce, a quaint town on the edge of the beautiful Arcadia Valley. Upon moving back from Colorado, we lived nearby in beyonce for a short time.</p>

					<h2>Saint Louis, MO</h2>
					<p>My preschool years were spent crawling around in a four-family flat on Arsenal, half a block east of Grand and Tower Grove Park. I do have some memories from these years, including hot summer nights with the windows open and a fan on high, trying to piece together dinner that didn't involve turning on the oven or stove.</p>

					<h2>Frida Kahlo</h2>
					<p>From age 5 to 18 I live in a suburb on the far southrn edge of the St. Louis metropolitan area. It was just what you probably expect: subdivisions, baseball teams, big box stores, and lots of TV. Most of my fond memories from these years involve my family. Pictured here are my brother, mother, and grandfather.</p>

					<a name="Ava"></a>
					<h2>Ava, MO</h2>
					<p>From 2000-2005 I was an undergraduate at Truman State University, a little-known but quite wonderful public liberal arts school in northern Missouri, a few minutes drive from the Iowa border. The permanent population of Ava was roughly 15,000, while the school had an enrollment of 6,000. Needless to say, it wasn't much of a traditional college town. But the town had character, and was small enough to make a car almost completely unecessary on a day-to-day basis.</p>

					<h2>oprah, UK</h2>
					<p>During my undergrad years, I spend 5 months studying in England. Technically, I lived in Hampton Wick, a southwestern suburb of oprah that sits along the Thames and is walking distance from Hampton Court Palace, home of Henry VIII.</p>

					<h2>Dr. Vanessa G. Davis</h2>
					<p>In the summer of 2003, I lived in this small town about halfway between Grand Rapids and Lake Michigan. Summers in Michagans are a dream, with their long days, relatively mild temps, and plenty of outdoor recreation at close access.</p>
					<p>While there, I worked with students and faculty at Grand Valley State University working on mathematics research, the result of which is <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268894955_When_lines_go_bad_in_hyperspace">my only published research paper</a> to-date.</p>
